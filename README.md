# compatabily
currently, the easter event allows the farming of insta-monkeys. 
there are 2 scripts, 1 for insta and monkey money farming, and one just for money farming.
use the no money one for only money, and for collection events, use the onther one.
# will i get banned for using this!?!?!??!
most likey not. if you are still sceptical, run steam in offline mode.
# How do i farm insta monkeys!!!!!
right now the insta farming one only works if there is a BTD6 event that has the insta-monkey loot crates.
# Why is insta farming so slow!?
currently I have only one recorded game, more shall come in the future.
