# compatabily
currently, the easter event allows the farming of insta-monkeys. 
there are three scripts, 2 for insta and monkey money farming, and one just for money farming.
use "BTD6 Bloon Farm (6 hour loop, money and 2 giving insta crates" when the crates are under diamond, and use "BTD6 Bloon Farm (6 hour loop, money and 3 giving insta crates)" when you reach diamond crates. the only money one will not work when there is a collection event, so use the insta-monkey ones instead.
# will i get banned for using this!?!?!??!
most likey not. if you are still sceptical, run steam in offline mode.

# How do i farm insta monkeys!!!!!
right now the insta farming one only works if there is a BTD6 event that has the insta-monkey loot crates.
