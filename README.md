# compatabily
currently, the easter event allows the farming of insta-monkeys. 
there are two scripts, one for insta and monkey money farming, and one just for money farming.
i do not know if the insta-monkey farming one works yet, but it *should* work. i still have some testing to do.
# will i get banned for using this!?!?!??!
most likey not. if you are still sceptical, run steam in offline mode.

# it won't work for tier 4 crates and above?!?!??!
due to how you get more insta monkeys the higher level the crates are, it is hard to have the script know how many you will get. i am working on a solution.
